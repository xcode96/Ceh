        "id": "sample-q2",
        "question": "In the context of information security, what does 'Non-repudiation' guarantee?",
        "options": [
          "That a sender cannot deny having sent a message",
          "That the data is encrypted",
          "That the system is always available",

        "correctAnswer": "That a sender cannot deny having sent a message",
        "explanation": "Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of the data. It ensures that the sender cannot deny sending the message or the validity of its contents.",

        "correctAnswer": "-sS",
        "explanation": "-sS performs a TCP SYN scan, also known as a half-open scan. It sends a SYN packet and waits for a response but does not complete the 3-way handshake, making it harder to detect.",

        "options": [
          "To detect open UDP ports",
          "To identify the operating system",
          "To send packets with FIN, URG, and PSH flags set to bypass firewalls",
          "To check for Christmas vulnerabilities"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To send packets with FIN, URG, and PSH flags set to bypass firewalls",
        "explanation": "A Xmas scan sets the FIN, URG, and PSH flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree. It is used to manipulate the TCP stack of the target to infer port status and bypass stateless firewalls.",
